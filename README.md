Most basic layout programs should be able to consume these datafiles.

I am using Swift Publisher 5 in spub format, available on the apple app store. 

Process: 
1. create your CSV by copying the main_template.csv you want to use.
2. rename the file in the format of YEAReEVENTNUMBER. EX 2023e3.csv 
3. Add the data with excel, sheets, or any txt editor . 
4. Rename the old template to archive_XXX_nameorfile.txt 
5. Rename your file to match the old filename.

We need to do the file renames so that that data file references in the template are valid
